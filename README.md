## About
cricket scorecard webapp using react. webapp is used to maintain the score of the team and individual players with runs, balls & strike rate including bowler's total over, maiden, runs given, economy, etc.

## Problem

Currently data has been managed using state. Hence don't refresh the page until the completion of match otherwise all data will be gone. For that you can use android application which you can **download** from the **Release Section**.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
